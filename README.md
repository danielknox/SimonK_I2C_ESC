# SimonK_I2C_ESC
A simple I2C library for ESCs using the Blue Robotics version of SimonK's TGY firmware (https://github.com/bluerobotics/tgy). This library supports the BlueESC, but also the Afro Nfet 30A. I2C is an alternative interface for micro-controllers, rather than using PWM (as a servo) -- this provides some additional features like: temperature, voltage, RPM, etc.
